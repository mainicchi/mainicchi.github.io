        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>Hi, names Maini Tran and I'm currently advancing through my last year as a digital design student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. 
        My journey in the design realm has been marked by a commitment to continuous learning and growth. I am enthusiastic about delving deeper into the field of UX/UI design and to always learn something new. I pride myself on my proactive approach to challenges and striving for the best in my work. I aim for usability and accessibility in the end product. I also want to bringing creativity and functionality together to create designs that leave a lasting impact.
        Outside of work I enjoy travel, photography, cocktail making and hosting crafting nights for my friends.</p>

<h2>My basic project workflow</h2>

<h4>Understand</h4>
    <p>Gain knowledge of users, context, technologies, and the brand. 
    The problem of the user has to be identified to later start working towards the solutions. 
    Understanding the mission and goals is crucial to get the right answers.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Gathering data by 1:1 interviewing, focus groups, surveys and usability testing for example and to base assumptions on real life evidence/data.</p>
<h4>Analyze</h4>
    <p>Build user personas (these act as guides) on gathered data. Make user journeys and user scenarios to see the bigger picture.</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
    <p>Create site maps, user flows, and wireframes (low-fidelity mock-ups) based on gathered data.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
    <p>Evaluate design with the users to obtain feedback and develop the product in the design team. Continuous flow of feedback is needed to launch the right product.</p>
<h4>Evaluate</h4>
    <p>Investigate where the process went right and if the solutios really solved the problem of the users. With this knowledge, future projects will run even more smoothly.</p>
