        <h2>The long story</h2>
        <p>Our objective was to comprehensively revitalize Demoni ry's external image, establishing a robust presence across various social media channels and the official website while enhancing visibility within the student community.
            <br><br>The existing Demoni website faced challenges stemming from outdated information and the intricacies left unresolved by previous developers, notably a multitude of WordPress plugins left by the previous maker.</p>

    <div class="process">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>We undertook the creation of a fresh visual identity, providing detailed guidelines for the renewed Demon ry appearance. Leveraging these guidelines, we orchestrated the development of an overhauled website featuring updated content, seamlessly incorporating embedded elements linked to Blood Services and Instagram.

            <br><br>To adhere to a meticulously planned 13-week timeline, we intricately scheduled the planning and technical implementation processes. The content overhaul was effectively distributed among the team, fostering close collaboration with the client throughout the redesign journey. 
            <br><br>The project commenced with the generation of UI sketches, drawing insights from benchmarking various student association websites. Building on the acquired information, we crafted preliminary wireframes that underwent testing. Feedback from the testing guided us in refining and enhancing the designs. These finalized wireframes were seamlessly integrated into the planning process, aligning with the newly established graphic identity
            <br><br>In the layout iteration phase, we created two distinctive versions, allowing the client to select preferred features. The chosen elements were skilfully amalgamated into a cohesive, final version.</p>
